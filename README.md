# CodeSpaceProject
Project for the Codespace Academy video game design and development bootcamp.

It is a top-down 2D shooter where the main objetive is complete small missions who tell a story being part of a elite group called Rapid Intervention.
This project is about the first mission which serves to introduce the player to the story and mechanics.

I made a player and enemy controller for the movement, attacks and animations. The main enemy mechanic is a wave system when the player enter
a room. And finally, two bosses shooting the player.
